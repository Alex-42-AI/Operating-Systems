(USERLOG) Write a command procedure, that receives a user identifier as a parameter at the command line. The procedure periodically checks whether the user has started a session, in which case it stops the check, printing out an appropriate message.
(STRING_SEARCH) Write a command procedure, that receives the names of existing text files passed as parameters at the command line. The procedure reads from the standard input a string and for each file it prints out appropriately the number of lines, that contain the string.
(MESS_USERS) Write a command procedure, that receives a list of system user identifiers passed as parameters at the command line. The procedure reads a message (text) from the standard input and sends it to these users in the list, who've started and are working in a session.
(CHECKSIZE) Write a command procedure, that receives 2 parameters at the command line, first - a string and second - a number. If a directory exists with a name, matching the string, the procedure prints out the names of all regular files in it, the size of which (in symbols) is at least as big as the given number. Otherwise it prints out an appropriate message.
