Write a command procedure, that receives the name of an existing directory passed as a parameter at the command line. It reads the name of an existing file from the standard input. It replaces the first 2 lines of each regular file in the directory with the first 2 lines of the read file.
Write a command procedure, that receives at least 3 parameters at the command line: 1 - a number, 2 - the name of an existing directory and the rest - a list of users names. The procedure reads text from the standard input. For each user in the list, who's in a session, if the given directory has a subdirectory with the name of the user, it finds the number of files in it. If this number is greater than the number, passed as a first parameter, the user is sent the read text as a message. If it's less, the user's name, along with the number of files, formatted appropriately, are written in a file, sorted alphabetically based on the users names.
